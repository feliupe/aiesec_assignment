# aiesec_assignment

## Specification ##

Write a basic publish-subscribe API!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern

The API should provide the following functionality:

1. Register/Unregister a subscriber to a topic - can be a string
2. Register/Unregister a publisher to a topic 
3. Publish a note to a topic
4. Receive a published note as a subscriber

The subscribers can receive notes either via push or pull - you decide!

## Assignment Rules ##

The assignment must comply with these rules:

1. The entire implementation must be in a single Git repository
2. The assignment should take no longer than 3-4 hours: If you have used the alloted hours just hand-in what you got! We would rather see a few good lines of code than a hurried mess
3. The code and configuration must be concise and readable. We dont care about your choice of technology - you can even use an existing publisher-subscribe framework if that is easy for you! What we care about is solving the challenge with the tools that you like to use!
4. Please use the last 5 minutes of the challenge to write a few lines about why you chose the technologies you've used. 
e.g.: "I write in Python because it's easy to prototype..."
